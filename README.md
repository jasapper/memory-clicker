# Memory Clicker
Loosely based on the timeless Concentration flash card game, Memory Clicker will display grid of 12 cards each bearing a character image from a certain animated television series. The object of the app/game is to click each character successively without clicking the same one again. To keep things interesting the grid will reshuffle randomly each time a card is clicked. If a character is clicked more than once the game (and score) starts over. The highest score achieved during each visit is also displayed. A live demo of this app can be found [HERE](https://memory-clicker.herokuapp.com/).

## Mobile friendly
Memory Clicker is fully responsive; individual elements will resize accordingly based on screen size.

## Installation
Memory Clicker is written in ReactJS and so requires NodeJS to already be installed locally. After cloning the repository (or download and extracting) open a terminal/commandline in the new directory.
First install the required Node modules:
`npm install` OR `yarn install`
Then start the development server and run the app:
`npm start` OR `yarn start`
Once running visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
ENJOY!
